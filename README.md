This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error handling scenario. The `bug.py` file showcases a function with a specific TypeError handling. This handles cases where one operand is not an int or float, preventing implicit type coercion.  The `bugSolution.py` is similar but with a more robust handling approach. This example highlights the importance of careful error handling to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.
